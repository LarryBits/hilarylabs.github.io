This is a documentation of all IT projects that I’ve completed or am currently building. There are also upcoming projects that might caught my interest. I use this site to archive configurations, tools, diagrams, and concepts so that if I may need them again, I can easily refer — and of course to showcase the knowledge that I have gained and my skills.

Feel free to browse them <a href="https://hilarylabs.github.io/">here</a> and reuse my work for your learning or inspiration. If you're using any of the content commercially, I kindly ask for credit. I am not responsible for any issues caused by implementing these projects in live or offline environments. Use it on your own risk.
